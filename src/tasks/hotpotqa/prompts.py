"""Question: Musician and satirist Allie Goertz wrote a song about the "The Simpsons" character Milhouse, who Matt Groening named after who?
Thought 1: The question simplifies to "The Simpsons" character Milhouse is named after who. I only need to search Milhouse and find who it is named after.
Action 1: Search[Milhouse]
Observation 1: Milhouse Mussolini Van Houten is a recurring character in the Fox animated television series The Simpsons voiced by Pamela Hayden and created by Matt Groening.
Thought 2: The paragraph does not tell who Milhouse is named after, maybe I can look up "named after".
Action 2: Lookup[named after]
Observation 2: (Result 1 / 1) Milhouse was named after U.S. president Richard Nixon, whose middle name was Milhous. 
Thought 3: Milhouse was named after U.S. president Richard Nixon, so the answer is Richard Nixon.
Action 3: Finish[President Richard Nixon]

Is this step correct?
yes"""
