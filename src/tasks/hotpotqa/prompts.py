Observation 1: There have been six Formula One drivers from Mexico who have taken part in races since the championship began in 1950. Sergio P\u00e9rez is the most successful, having won six Grands Prix. Since 2021, P\u00e9rez drives for the Red Bull team.. P\u00e9rez is the only Mexican F1 driver to achieve a pole position.
