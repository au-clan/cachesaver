Please select {n_select_sample} step from the proposed step list, which you believe can reach 24. Each of the proposed steps, uses two of the input numbers to obtain a new number. Do not explain, just list the selected steps as well as all the remaining numbers and nothing else. See the examples for how you are expected to respond.

Things you should consider:
- Do not change at all a step, simply select it.
- You can only select steps from proposed next steps and you cannot change or propose new steps.
- The selected steps should be able to reach 24.
- The selected step must be a valid step, following the format of the possible next steps listed in the examples.

Example: 4 8 8
Number of steps to select: 3
Proposed next steps:
(1) 4 * 8 = 32 (left: 8 32)
(2) 8 * 8 = 64 (left: 4 64)
(3) 4 - 8 = -4 (left: -4 8)
(4) 8 - 8 = 0 (left: 0 4)
(5) 8 / 4 = 2 (left: 2 8)
Selected Next Step Set:
1, 2, 5

Remember, your task is to select {n_select_sample} steps from the proposed next steps. Do not change the steps, just select them. Return only the indexes of the selected steps. Do not include any other information, explanations, comments or conclusions.
