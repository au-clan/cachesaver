bfs = '''Use numbers and basic arithmetic operations (+ - * /). Each step, you are only allowed to choose two of the remaining numbers to obtain a new number. Do not explain simply list possible next steps as well as all the remaining numbers and nothing else.

Example: 2 8 8 14
Possible next steps:
2 + 8 = 10 (left: 8 10 14)
8 / 2 = 4 (left: 4 8 14)
14 + 2 = 16 (left: 8 8 16)
2 * 8 = 16 (left: 8 14 16)
8 - 2 = 6 (left: 6 8 14)

Example: 1 3
Possible next steps:
1 + 3 = 4 (left: 4)
1 * 3 = 3 (left: 3)
3 - 1 = 2 (left: 2)
3 / 1 = 3 (left: 3)
1 - 3 = -2 (left: -2)

cot = '''Use numbers and basic arithmetic operations (+ - * /) to obtain 24. Return only the complete answer.

Example: 4 4 6 8
Steps:
4 + 8 = 12 (left: 4 6 12)
6 - 4 = 2 (left: 2 12)
2 * 12 = 24 (left: 24)
Answer: (6 - 4) * (4 + 8) = 24

Example: 2 9 10 12
Steps:
12 * 2 = 24 (left: 9 10 24)
10 - 9 = 1 (left: 1 24)
24 * 1 = 24 (left: 24)
Answer: (12 * 2) * (10 - 9) = 24

Example: 4 9 10 13
Steps:
13 - 10 = 3 (left: 3 4 9)
9 - 3 = 6 (left: 4 6)
4 * 6 = 24 (left: 24)
Answer: 4 * (9 - (13 - 10)) = 24

Example: 1 4 8 8
Steps:
8 / 4 = 2 (left: 1 2 8)
1 + 2 = 3 (left: 3 8)
3 * 8 = 24 (left: 24)
Answer: (1 + 8 / 4) * 8 = 24

Example: 5 5 5 9
Steps:
5 + 5 = 10 (left: 5 9 10)
10 + 5 = 15 (left: 9 15)
15 + 9 = 24 (left: 24)
Answer: ((5 + 5) + 5) + 9 = 24

# Updated
evaluate = '''Evaluate if given numbers can reach 24 by responding with the following: "sure", "likely" or "impossible". Follow the format of the following examples. Try to be brief.

Example: 10 14
10 + 14 = 24
sure

Example: 11 12
11 + 12 = 23
12 - 11 = 1
11 * 12 = 132
11 / 12 = 0.91
impossible

Example: 4 4 10
4 + 4 + 10 = 8 + 10 = 18
4 * 10 - 4 = 40 - 4 = 36
(10 - 4) * 4 = 6 * 4 = 24
sure

Example: 4 9 11
9 + 11 + 4 = 20 + 4 = 24
sure

Example: 5 7 8
5 + 7 + 8 = 12 + 8 = 20
(8 - 5) * 7 = 3 * 7 = 21
I cannot obtain 24 now, but numbers are within a reasonable range
likely

Example: 5 6 6
5 + 6 + 6 = 17
(6 - 5) * 6 = 1 * 6 = 6
I cannot obtain 24 now, but numbers are within a reasonable range
likely

Example: 10 10 11
10 + 10 + 11 = 31
(11 - 10) * 10 = 10
10 10 10 are all too big
impossible

Example: 1 3 3
1 * 3 * 3 = 9
(1 + 3) * 3 = 12
1 3 3 are all too small
impossible
