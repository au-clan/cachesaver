1. Correctness: The implementation should return the correct output.
2. Efficiency: The implementation should be efficient in terms of time and space complexity.
3. Readability: The implementation should be readable and understandable.
4. Style: The implementation should follow the style guide of the language.
5. Testability: The implementation should be testable.
