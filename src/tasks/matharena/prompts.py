# Step-by-step analysis prompt
act = '''Given a math problem, analyze it step by step. Each step should either analyze the problem, explain concepts, or provide the final answer.

Example Problem: Find the area of a circle with radius 5cm.
Step: Analyze[problem]
The problem asks for the area of a circle given its radius of 5cm.

Example Problem: Solve the equation 2x + 4 = 12
Step: Analyze[solution approach]
We need to isolate x by subtracting 4 from both sides and then dividing by 2.

# Complete solution chain-of-thought prompt
cot = '''Solve the given math problem step by step, showing your work and reasoning.

Example Problem: Solve 3x + 6 = 15
Steps:
Analyze[problem] Linear equation with one variable x
Explain[math concepts] Need to isolate x by using inverse operations
Analyze[solution approach] Subtract 6 from both sides, then divide by 3
Explain[solution steps] 3x = 9, then x = 3
Finish[3]
